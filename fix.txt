Gaps & Pragmatic Next Steps
1. CLI Commands (Priority: High)
Missing operational tooling:

meridian events listen [--stream transaction]
meridian index create <name> --dimension 1536
meridian index status <name>
meridian context explain <context_id>

2. Integration Tests (Priority: High)
Need tests covering:

Event → Trigger → Feature Refresh flow
Vector search end-to-end
Context assembly with caching
Time travel queries
3. Production Hardening (Priority: Medium)
Item	Description
Dead Letter Queue	Failed events should move to DLQ after N retries
Rate Limiting	Batch embedding calls with backoff
Connection Pooling	pgvector connection pool tuning
Streaming Assembly	Large contexts should stream chunks
4. Documentation (Priority: Medium)
Quickstart guide for context store
API reference for /ingest, /context/{id}/explain
Examples for @context, @retriever, @index
