# Meridian: Heroku for ML Features

> **"Define features in Python. Get training data and production serving for free."**

Meridian is a developer-first feature store designed to take you from a Jupyter notebook to production in 30 seconds. It eliminates the infrastructure tax of existing tools—no Kubernetes, no Spark, no YAML. Just pure Python and SQL.

## ⚡ The 30-Second Quickstart

**1. Install**
```bash
pip install "meridian-oss[ui]"
```

**2. Define Features**
```python
# features.py
from meridian.core import FeatureStore, entity, feature
from datetime import timedelta

store = FeatureStore()

@entity(store)
class User:
    user_id: str

@feature(entity=User, refresh=timedelta(minutes=5), materialize=True)
def user_click_count(user_id: str) -> int:
    return 42
```

**3. Serve & Visualize**
```bash
meridian serve features.py
# OR
meridian ui features.py
```

## 🚀 Why Meridian?

### 1. Local-First, Cloud-Ready
Most feature stores require a platform team to set up. Meridian runs on your laptop with zero dependencies (DuckDB + In-Memory) and scales to production with boring technology (Postgres + Redis).

### 2. No Magic, Just Python
We don't use YAML for configuration. Your code is your config.
- **Explicit Caching:** Use `@feature(materialize=True)` to cache hot features.
- **Explicit Refresh:** Use `@feature(refresh="5m")` to define freshness.

### 3. Instant Wow ✨
- **Meridian UI:** A built-in Streamlit dashboard to explore your data.
- **Rich Terminal:** Production-grade TUI with live metrics.
- **Jupyter Integration:** Beautiful HTML representations of your feature store objects.

### 4. Production-Grade Reliability 🛡️
- **Fallback Chain:** Cache -> Compute -> Default. If Redis fails, we compute on-demand.
- **Circuit Breakers:** Built-in protection against cascading failures (fail fast).
- **Deep Observability:** Prometheus metrics (`meridian_feature_requests_total`) and structured JSON logging out of the box.
- **Async Core:** Fully async I/O for high-throughput serving.

### 5. Hybrid Features (New in v1.1.0) 🏭
- **Python Features:** Use `@feature` with Python logic for complex math (e.g., Haversine distance).
- **SQL Features:** Use `@feature(sql="...")` to delegate heavy joins to your warehouse (DuckDB/Postgres).
- **Materialization:** Automatically run SQL queries and bulk-load results into Redis.

### 6. Point-in-Time Correctness (New in v1.1.0) 🕰️
- **No Data Leakage:** We use `ASOF JOIN` (DuckDB) and `LATERAL JOIN` (Postgres) to ensure training data reflects the world *exactly* as it was at the event time.
- **Consistent:** Same logic for offline training and online serving.

### 7. Write Once, Run Anywhere (New in v1.1.0) 🛠️
- **Dev:** `MERIDIAN_ENV=development` (default) uses DuckDB + In-Memory.
- **Prod:** `MERIDIAN_ENV=production` uses Async Postgres + Redis.
- **Zero Code Changes:** Your feature definitions stay exactly the same.
