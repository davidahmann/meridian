All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.1.0] - 2025-12-05

### 🚀 Major Features

*   **Production Stack (`MERIDIAN_ENV=production`)**: full support for running in production with Postgres (Async) and Redis.
*   **Point-in-Time Correctness**:
    *   Development: Uses DuckDB `ASOF JOIN` logic for zero leakage.
    *   Production: Uses Postgres `LATERAL JOIN` logic for zero leakage.
*   **Async Offline Store**: `PostgresOfflineStore` now uses `asyncpg` for high-throughput I/O.
*   **Hybrid Feature Fixes**: Correctly merges Python (on-the-fly) and SQL (batch) features in retrieval.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
